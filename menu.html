            <h1>How to Play Rock, Paper, Scissors</h1>
            <br>
            <p>Rock, Paper, Scissors (aka "Ro-Sham-Bo", janken, "Bato, Bato, Pick" and "Scissors, Paper, Stone") is a simple hand game that is played around the world, with many different names and variations. It is commonly used as a way of coming to decisions, and in some cases is even played for sport. The rules require that competing players use one hand to form one of three shapes at an agreed-upon time. The person that plays the strongest “object” is the winner of the game. It's that easy! Rock, Paper, Scissors is a simple game that anybody can play and win. There is no obvious advantage to the stronger, older, more experienced opponent.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Play rock. To play “rock,” simply ball your hand up into a fist when you and your opponent shoot. Rock beats scissors, but loses to paper.
                    <ul>
                        <li>People tend to throw rock more often than the other shapes, especially if they're inexperienced. Remember this when choosing which object to play.</li>
                        <li>Try to predict your opponent's next move by paying attention to their patterns.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Play paper. Throw “paper” by extending your hand palm down with your fingers outstretched. Paper wins against rock, but loses to scissors.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Paper is a good object to throw if you're undecided because there's a bigger chance that your opponent will play rock than scissors.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Play scissors. For "scissors," use two fingers to mimic the shape of an open pair of scissors. Scissors has an advantage over paper but can be beat by rock.
                    <ul>
                        <li>If you find yourself losing when you throw rock, switch to scissors. This will help you overcome an opponent who relies on paper.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
